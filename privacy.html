  <h1>Privacy Policy for SolScanner</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 24, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>SolScanner is a Chrome extension that allows users to analyze Solana-based tokens for safety, liquidity, insider activity, and other relevant information. We are committed to maintaining your privacy and protecting any data that may be processed while using the extension.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>SolScanner does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data</strong>. All analysis and data handling is done locally within your browser. No data is sent to any external server controlled by us.</p>

  <h2>3. What Information Is Accessed?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Token contract addresses (entered by the user)</li>
    <li>Publicly available token metadata (from blockchain APIs)</li>
    <li>Basic interaction logs for debugging (console-only and local)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is only used to render the token analysis features of the extension and is <strong>never stored, shared, or transmitted externally</strong>.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>SolScanner interacts with public APIs such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>RugCheck</strong> (for scam detection data)</li>
    <li><strong>Helius API</strong> (for Solana token and transaction data)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services may have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them if you have concerns.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
  <p>SolScanner does not use cookies, analytics tools, or any tracking mechanisms. We do not monitor your browsing activity or usage of other websites.</p>

  <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The extension requests only the minimal permissions required to operate, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>`activeTab` – to interact with the content of the current tab if needed</li>
    <li>`storage` – to save user preferences like watchlists locally</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since we do not transmit or store any data, there are no centralized databases or servers that could be compromised. Your data remains in your browser and under your control.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will update this page and revise the "Effective Date" at the top. Continued use of the extension after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
